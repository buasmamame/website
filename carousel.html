			  <p>At Mamame, we have a big, bold vision: to help moms feel like the superheroes they truly are by giving them the tools they need to prioritize their own self-care. We believe that taking care of yourself shouldn't be a guilty pleasure, but a daily ritual that fuels your body, mind, and spirit. So, if you're ready to join our self-care revolution and unleash your inner superhero, let's do this!</p> </div>

            <p>At Mamame, we are on a mission to empower mothers of young children to become the best versions of themselves by tackling head-on the challenges of exhaustion and lack of personal time. We firmly believe that self-care is not selfish, but a vital ingredient for a healthy and fulfilling life.</p>
            <p>In a world where we're constantly told to prioritize our children's needs above our own, we believe that we must be egoistic and prioritize our own time and relaxation, so we can be a role model for our children, because only by loving and caring for ourselves can we love somebody else.</p>

		    <h1>Values:&nbsp;The Secret Sauce to Our Success</h1>
		    <ul>
			  <li><strong>Self-Care:</strong> Prioritizing self-care as a non-negotiable and essential aspect of a healthy and fulfilling life.</li>
			  <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Demonstrating compassion and understanding towards the challenges that mothers face in their daily lives, and working to create a supportive community where they can feel seen, heard, and valued.</li>
			  <li><strong>Egoism:</strong> Taking care of oneself is not selfish, but rather an act of love and respect towards oneself. It is important to acknowledge that mothers often put the needs of others before their own and that taking time for oneself can improve overall well-being and benefit everyone involved. Encouraging mothers to prioritize their own needs in a positive and empowering way can lead to improved health, happiness, and success in all areas of life.</li>
			  <li><strong>Mindfulness:</strong> Being present in the moment, aware of your thoughts and feelings, and accepting them without judgment. This can lead to a sense of calm and relaxation, as well as improved mental health and well-being. </li>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Name: Elena van Dijk</p>
<p>Married to: Jeffrey van Dijk </p>
			  <p>Age: 32</p>
			  <p>Occupation: Works at the office (PR) 3 days a week. </p>
			  <p>Personal life: Elena is a loving mother to a 3-year-old daughter named Emma. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Jeffrey, who works as an engineer in a nearby town. They live in a small suburban house with a cozy backyard, where she takes care of the household tasks like cleaning and cooking. On the days that she isn’t at the office she tries to combine this tasks with spending time with Emma. </p>
			  <p>Before becoming a mother, Elena worked as a marketing specialist at a local firm. She loved her job, but always knew she wanted to start a family with her high school sweetheart, Jeffrey. They had been together since they were 16 years old and were thrilled when they found out they were expecting their first child. In addition to her busy schedule as a mom, Elena also uses social media to stay connected with friends and family. She spends time scrolling through Facebook to catch up with old friends from college and keep up with the latest news. On Instagram, she enjoys following mom bloggers and influencers who share tips and advice on parenting and self-care. She also uses Pinterest to find new recipes to try out in the kitchen and inspiration for home decor projects.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Daily routine: Elena’s day starts early, around 6:00 am, when Emma wakes up. She spends the morning by firstly taking care of her daughter's needs, preparing breakfast for the two of them, dressing her and cleaning up. Once Emma is settled with her toys, Elena tries to squeeze in some time for herself to take a shower and dress up. However, Elena usually has little time to take care of herself since Emma is very energetic. So ideally Elena tries to do whatever she want to do for herself the evening before.
                
                The rest of the day is spent playing with Emma, taking her to the park, doing groceries together or visiting family. Elena’s husband, Jeffrey, comes home from work around 5:30 pm, and they have dinner as a family. After dinner, Elena puts Emma to bed and then collapses on the couch from exhaustion.</p>
              <p>Elena's daily routine is jam-packed, but she tries to find moments throughout the day to check her social media accounts. She enjoys sharing pictures and updates of her life as a mom on Instagram and Facebook, and often uses Pinterest to gather ideas for fun activities to do with her daughter.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Challenges: Elena loves being a mom, but she struggles with sleep deprivation and the feeling of not having enough time for herself. Emma is a high-energy child who requires constant supervision, which leaves Elena with little time to do things she enjoys, such as reading or watching her favorite TV show. She feels guilty for leaving her daughter with someone else at home while she does something nice for herself. Whenever such an arrangement is made she feels obliged to make sure her daughter is also having a good time while she is gone. To avoid all this guilt and effort she often chooses to simply stay at home and be with her daughter herself.</p>
              <p>She hopes to find a way to balance her responsibilities as a mother with her own needs for self-care and personal time.&nbsp;</p>
