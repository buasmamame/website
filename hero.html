			  <p>Mothers are superheroes. They juggle a million different responsibilities every day, from running the household to taking care of their children, and everything in between. But in the midst of all this chaos, it's easy to forget one crucial thing: themselves. That's right, we said it - mothers need to be more egoistic. They need to prioritize themselves and their own needs, for the sake of their own health and wellbeing, as well as that of their families. Because the truth is, when mothers neglect their own needs, everyone suffers. Stress levels rise, patience wears thin, and burnout becomes a very real possibility. On the other hand, when mothers take the time to care for themselves - whether that means scheduling some alone time, indulging in a hobby, or simply getting enough sleep - they are better equipped to handle the challenges of motherhood with grace and ease. So, to all the moms out there - it's time to put yourself first. Trust us, your family will thank you for it.</p>
  <p>Are you a superhero mom who's constantly on the go? Do you feel like there's never enough time in the day to relax and unwind?

		  <row> <h1>Our Story: How We Went from Zero to Hero</h1>
			  <p>Allow us to introduce ourselves - we are ZoÃ«, Valeski, Flora, and Anna, four Creative Business students on a mission to help mothers everywhere find more time to relax and unwind.

Now, we know what you might be thinking - "How can a bunch of non-moms possibly understand the challenges of motherhood?" But here's the thing - even though we don't have children ourselves, we've all experienced the stress and overwhelm that can come with juggling a million responsibilities. Whether it's school, work, or just the general chaos of life, we know what it's like to feel like there aren't enough hours in the day.

That's why we're passionate about helping moms find ways to prioritize self-care and take a break from the constant demands of motherhood. We believe that every mom deserves to feel rested, rejuvenated, and ready to take on the world. And with our combined skills and creativity, we're confident that we can make that happen.

So, whether you're a busy mom in need of a little R&R, or just someone who could use a break from the daily grind, we're here for you. Let's work together to make relaxation a top priority - for moms everywhere.</p>
